## ✨ What is this?

**Coursera Marathon** is a Chrome extension that automates your way through any Coursera course. It plays only video lectures (seeking to the last third so they complete fast), skips all non-video items like quizzes, readings, and assignments, and marks everything as complete via Coursera's own API — so your progress is real and saved.

Start the marathon, close the laptop lid, come back to a completed course.

---

## 🏃 Features

### 🎬 Video Marathon
| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Lecture-only playback** | Plays only `/lecture/` pages — skips everything else |
| **Auto seek to last third** | Jumps to 66% of video duration on load so it ends in seconds |
| **Speed enforcement** | Locks playback at your chosen speed (0.5× – 4×) — Coursera can't override it |
| **Auto-play** | Resumes automatically if Coursera pauses the video |
| **Smart course completion** | Detects end of course via URL tracking — stops cleanly with a banner |

### ⏭️ Smart Skipping
| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Skips all non-lectures** | Supplements, quizzes, exams, peer reviews, labs, discussions, assignments |
| **API completion marking** | Calls Coursera's own APIs to mark skipped items as complete |
| **No looping** | End-of-course watchdog (`_eocTimer`) detects when navigation stops — finishes gracefully |

### ⚡ Manual Controls
| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| **▶ Next Lesson** | Jump to the next item immediately |
| **⏩ +30s Skip** | Skip forward 30 seconds in the current video |

### 🎛️ Settings
| Toggle | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Auto-advance** | Automatically goes to next lesson when video ends |
| **Unlock seeking** | Lets you scrub freely in any video (bypasses Coursera's seek lock) |
| **Auto-play** | Resumes playback if Coursera pauses it |
| **Skip countdowns** | Auto-dismisses "Next in 5s…" overlay popups |
| **Playback speed** | Slider from 0.5× to 4× — enforced as a floor, Coursera can't go lower |

### 📡 API Progress Capture
The extension intercepts Coursera's own network calls and replays them with 100% completion values — the same data Coursera itself sends. Your progress shows up correctly in the dashboard.

```

The extension runs entirely in the **page's MAIN world** — no background service workers needed for core functionality. A lightweight `injector.js` in the ISOLATED world bridges Chrome storage settings and popup messages into the page.

## 🙋 Support

**Something not working?**

1. Make sure you're on `coursera.org` — the extension only activates there
2. Try refreshing the page and reopening the popup
3. If marathon starts from the beginning mid-course, stop and restart it from the current lecture

**Common issues:**

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Play a video to capture API calls" always shows | Play any lecture manually first to let the extension capture network calls |
| Marathon stops early | Course may be genuinely complete — check the 🎓 banner |
| Speed not changing | Some Coursera players resist overrides — try toggling Auto-play off and on |
| Extension not visible | Make sure it's pinned (puzzle icon → pin it) |
